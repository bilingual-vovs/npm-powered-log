## **Package setting up**
In our documentation we will change original console object to our's, so our input will look like  this:   

    const console = require("powered-log")

## **Log coloring**
To make colored log and masages at all we use, color names that included in [styles.md](./docs/styles.md). You need to set them as a param type string after fuction arguments list, you can set as meny styles and colors as you want. 
#### Something like this:

        conosole.log("Hello powere-log", "red", "unDerScrOrE")

## Flexible directed logging
Our package alows you to use save all your logs in some files. You can set for your log text many writing directories. They must be type string and you can set them as many is you want.
**Remember - colors won't be saved**

#### For example:

        console.log("Hey write me to dir", "red", "./logs/app.log", "./logs/fun.log")
        console.err("Wrong input", "./log/err.log")

## **Advanced `log`, `warn`, `error`:**
### **`log`**

>> * `theArgs`:
>>   * **style** - one of styles in [style.md](./docs/styles.md) *(type : string)* *(you can add as many styles as you want, **isn't case insensitive**)*
>>   * **dir** - every directory to write this log text *(type : string)* *(you can add as many dirs as you want, **isn't case insensitive**)*
> #### **This func don't have output**  
>  
> **P.S -** you should use this function to write some messages in terminal or console and save them to directories, but we recomend to use another function in our packadge. You can find more at [doc.md](./docs/Doc.md#log)

### **`warn`**

> #### **Syntax**
> 
>     console.error(yourText, ...theArgs)
